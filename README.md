Apache Flink: Performance and Testing
=======


Flink performance tests

Add

WordCount
WordCount NoComb

K-Means
- low dimensional (3 dimensions k =20)
- high dimensional (1000 dimensions, k =200)

TPC-H with two joins and aggregation (Q3 if suitable)

Connected components

PageRank





Contains (for now) one large test job that tests all Flink components.

## Background information

This code originated from the Stratosphere.eu project. It is now called Apache Flink (incubating).

Original issue for planning this feature: https://github.com/stratosphere/stratosphere/issues/379



## Preparation

### Generate TPC-H Data

Download and build the TPC-H generate tool using `./prepareTPCH.sh`.

Generate data using `./generateTPCH.sh`

### Generate Special Data

1. Generate Avro File

This command will generate an Avro file from the original TPC-H orders file. (This step is not necessary when running the test job locally.)

```
java -cp target/testjob-0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar eu.stratosphere.test.testPlan.LargeTestPlan '/input/orders.tbl' '/output/orders.avro'
```

2. Generate Sequence File

```
java -cp target/testjob-0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar eu.stratosphere.test.testPlan.SequenceFileGenerator SeqOut 1000000 15
```

## Execute Plan

### Execute Plan with LocalExecutor

The following parameters need to be passed to the main()-Method of LargeTestPlan (in that order).

### Execute Plan on Cluster

The following parameters need to be passed to the Job (in that order). The Avro file and the Sequence file need to be generated previously.

| Parameter                | Description                                                            | Example                    |
